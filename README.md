The task involves installing Hadoop on a computer, understanding its functionality, and developing a Java program for Hadoop to extract and reduce information from a dataset. Emphasizing the application of MapReduce algorithms for Big Data analysis, the goal is to identify valuable insights for a commercial company's competitive advantage. Additionally, visualizing the dataset using tools like PowerBI is used to uncover information not apparent through MapReduce algorithms alone. The focus is on creating a comprehensive solution that combines various attributes for meaningful data extraction.
